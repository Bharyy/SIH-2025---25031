## 🌍 Problem Statement

Municipal issues like potholes, garbage collection, and broken infrastructure often go unreported or take weeks to resolve due to bureaucratic inefficiencies. Traditional complaint systems suffer from:

- ⏰ **Slow routing** through multiple administrative layers
- 📱 **Poor accessibility** for diverse citizen demographics  
- 🔍 **Lack of transparency** in issue resolution process
- 💬 **No real-time communication** between citizens and workers

**Our solution eliminates the middleman**, connecting citizens directly with frontline municipal workers through AI-powered classification and voice-first interaction.
