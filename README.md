## 🌍 Problem Statement

Municipal issues like potholes, garbage collection, and broken infrastructure often go unreported or take weeks to resolve due to bureaucratic inefficiencies. Traditional complaint systems suffer from:

- ⏰ **Slow routing** through multiple administrative layers
- 📱 **Poor accessibility** for diverse citizen demographics  
- 🔍 **Lack of transparency** in issue resolution process
- 💬 **No real-time communication** between citizens and workers

**Our solution eliminates the middleman**, connecting citizens directly with frontline municipal workers through AI-powered classification and voice-first interaction.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
